#TODOs
2. train/test splits  maybe should be a static allocation?

5. finish evaluate.py and train.py

13. for efficiency sake maybe add the option to load only the backbone features/only GCN features

6. realy important write scripts to download datasets and preprocess data
   both for pix3D and shapeNet

7. finish Cubify https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/tree/master/cuda
    there is another option explained at jit.py

8. for pix3D handle ROI_ALIGN and in general handle the backbone during training

9. in regards to training do we wish to train the whole model backbone+GCN together
   or train the backbone before the GCN

1.ensure we always use x,y,z as coords

12.evaluation metrics for pix3d and shapeNet

14. in general how to train and validate mask rcnn

11. any other TODO in the project

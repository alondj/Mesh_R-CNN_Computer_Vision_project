#TODOs
2. train/test splits  maybe should be a static allocation?
3. all data should be tensors or objects that support to(device) for mask_rcnn
3. have ground truths for the backbone networks aka ground truths for mask_rcnn and resnet50
   things like classes bounding boxes masks etc
5. finish evaluate.py and train.py

6. realy important write scripts to download datasets and preprocess data
   both for pix3D and shapeNet

7. finish Cubify https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/tree/master/cuda
    there is another option explained at jit.py

8. for pix3D handle ROI_ALIGN and in general handle the backbone during training

9. in regards to training do we wish to train the whole model backbone+GCN together
   or train the backbone before the GCN


9. any other TODO in the project

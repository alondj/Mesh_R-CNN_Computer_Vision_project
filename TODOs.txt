#TODOs
2. train/test splits  maybe should be a static allocation?

5. finish eval_dataset.py and train.py demo.py

13. for efficiency sake maybe add the option to load only the backbone features/only GCN features


# TODO we can generate pix3d pointclouds on the fly
# TODO downsample pix3d voxels can be used with torch
# TODO upsample shapenet via torch
# TODO normalize vertices positions

7. finish Cubify https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/tree/master/cuda
    there is another option explained at jit.py

8. for pix3D handle ROI_ALIGN and in general handle the backbone during training

1.ensure we always use x,y,z as coords

12.evaluation metrics for pix3d and shapeNet

14. in general how to train and validate mask rcnn

11. any other TODO in the project

1. num_samples of datasets should be for both datasets //DONE
2. train/test splits //DONE
3. have ground truths for the backbone networks aka ground truths for mask_rcnn and vgg16
   things like classes bounding boxes masks etc
4. pix3D has weird shapes need to see if it works
5. finish evaluate.py

6. realy important write scripts to download datasets and preprocess data
   both for pix3D and shapeNet

7. finish Cubify https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/tree/master/cuda
    there is another option explained at jit.py

8. for pix3D handle ROI_ALIGN and in general handle the backbone during training

9. any other TODO in the project

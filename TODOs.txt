#TODOs
2. train/test splits  maybe should be a static allocation?
3. have ground truths for the backbone networks aka ground truths for mask_rcnn and resnet50
   things like classes bounding boxes masks etc
5. finish evaluate.py and train.py

14. added custom target class for pix3D that supports to(device)

13. for efficiency sake maybe add the option to load only the backbone features/only GCN features

6. realy important write scripts to download datasets and preprocess data
   both for pix3D and shapeNet

7. finish Cubify https://github.com/pytorch/extension-cpp/tree/master/cuda
    there is another option explained at jit.py

8. for pix3D handle ROI_ALIGN and in general handle the backbone during training

9. in regards to training do we wish to train the whole model backbone+GCN together
   or train the backbone before the GCN

10. add backbone only training

12. consolidate checkpoints for the backbone and the GCN


11. any other TODO in the project
